       		<h1> Who I am and What This is</h1>
       		<p> This is a website that I set up for myself so that I could have a place to show off my many interests and projects. I felt that it would be beneficial to document all of the projects that I undertake both so I can see my process if I go back to a project and so that I can display my work to potential employers.In the links above I have included a link to a PDF of my resume as well as a link to my Projects page. There you can see photos and explanation on various projects I have completed both in school and on my own time. Now that you have an idea what you are looking at let me go into a little bit of who I am</p>
       		<p> My name is Matthew Elia and I am Electrical Engineering major at Northeastern University. To date I have completed my first experiential education experience with a 6 month internship at <a href='http://colorkinetics.com/'> Philips Color Kinetics</a>, a architectual LED lighting company within Philips Lighting. This was a great experience in which I learned many useful technical skills such as microscope soldering and prototype construction as well as and introduction in PCB design by using the software Altium to design a connector board for a project. Other relevant experience that I have includes work in a research lab run by Prof. Mark Niedre at Northeastern Univerisity know as the <a href="http://www1.ece.neu.edu/~mniedre/Site_2/Home.html">Biomedical Optics Research Group</a>. Here I worked under a PHD student to help with with there research into blood analysis through the use of lasers. This was my first hands on engineering experience outside the classroom and I was able to develop some basic skills such as wiring and cabling to better organize their system as well as a brief introduction to lasers and National Instruments DAQ using Matlab and Labview for signal collection. For more information on the skills that I have learned in the classroom up to this point click on the link to my Resume at the top of the page.</p>
